File Breakdown:
- db_accessor.php: contains funtions for accessing the database
- loader.php: is called to do progressive loading functions for the timemap

- plantmap.css: contains visual information

- plant_progressive.php: main script that renders the progressive timemap

- timeline_tester.php: testing file for playing around with timemap features


Known/Open Issues:
- Still kind of slow to load points
    -> use prepared statement?
- All points are green, would like to differentiate between search_terms (e.g. "summer" -> orange)
- Unable to load all datapoints, picking first 25 from each time interval to display 
    -> there are many, many more that are never considered!
- Some shown tweets are irrelevant/inappropriate
    -> requires more filtering
- Loads visualization with focus on the starting time (i.e. 2009)
    -> would like to focus on current time
